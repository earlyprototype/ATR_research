# EXP_010c — Results Record

**Spec:** `../../EXP_010c_SPEC.md` (pre-registered before any run).
**Status:** harness validated; registered run NOT yet executed.

## 2026-07-23 — Harness validation (no verdict weight)

**What ran:** `run_exp010c.py --tier smoke --harness-check` — the full pipeline
(prompt derivation → windowed gated loop → terminal capture → artifacts) on a
**random-init 24-layer toy model** (d_model=64, dummy vocab). 2 prompts × arms
{A0 0→23, A4 10→21}, max_iter=60.

**Why toy:** this session's remote environment blocks huggingface.co at the
network-policy layer (proxy CONNECT 403), so gpt2-medium weights cannot be
downloaded here. PyPI is open, so the ML stack installed fine (torch 2.13.0,
transformer_lens 3.5.1, py3.11). The toy run validates mechanics only:
hook wiring for arbitrary (i→j) windows, L0 natural-pass seeding, energy
rescaling, the lag-1 gate, per-arm checkpointing, terminal tensor capture,
JSON/pt artifact writing. All passed; artifacts:
`output/results_smoke_harness.json`, `output/terminals_smoke_harness.pt`.

**Observed (mechanically expected, no interpretation):** both arms converged;
the two windows locked onto *different* dummy terminals (A0 → `<903>`,
A4 → `<402>`), confirming the windows are genuinely wired to different layer
ranges.

**Prompt subset:** derived deterministically and recorded —
`output/prompt_subset.json` (25 prompts, round-robin over the 7 categories,
alphabetical by ID; recovered from the Stage 1 record
`experiments/gpt2_medium/output/dissolution_sentences.md` in the public repo,
since `prompt_library.py` is absent — deviation per spec §5).

## Pending (operator machine, models cached locally)

1. **Smoke with real weights:** `python run_exp010c.py --tier smoke`
   — A0 must reproduce the `D` collapse on E01/D01 (reproduction gate). Minutes.
2. **Pilot:** `python run_exp010c.py --tier pilot` — 5 prompts × 6 arms,
   max_iter=300. Directional signal only (non-registered tier). ~1–2 h CPU.
3. **Registered run:** `python run_exp010c.py --tier full` — 25 × 6, gated,
   max_iter=1000. Overnight CPU. Verdicts per spec §6 recorded HERE.
